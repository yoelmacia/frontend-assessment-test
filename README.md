# Code Test for Holiday Pirates ‚ò†Ô∏è

As a pirate to start, you must only install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Now you can start developing with

```bash
npm start
```

## 1. Hotel list ( Done )

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] We are modern pirates and love to navigate with our mobile devices too. Please optimize your presentation on all modern devices.
- [x] On our trips we want to have it more comfortable and the default hotel list should have minimum 3 ‚≠ê.
- [x] You will find a lot of data and information for one hotel. Show us you what you think is really important to present.
- [x] Pirates love to share their knowledge! Please find a way to show for every hotel also the reviews that we know what other pirates thing about the hotel.

**Bonus (extra chance for our pirate ship üîë):**

- [ ] Write some tests (integration, unit or e2e) which you find useful for your code. Use every test framework which you want.

**Optional:**
I discovered a little error of spell in the acceptance criteria : Pirates love to share their knowledge! Please find a way to show for every hotel also the reviews that we know what other pirates "thing" about the hotel.

- Did you miss something in our hotel API?

  Review score broken down by cleanliness, comfort and value for money, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10, to be able to make an average and be able to show it in the application.
  
  For example :

  ```bash
  score = {cleanliness: 4.2, comfort: 6.2, price_quality: 8}
  ```

### Product Requirements

Please use either a public GitHub repository for your solution or create a ZIP file and include every asset (images, data files,... [no node_modules folder please]) which we need to run the presentation on local. Your final code should run without any error in following desktop browser:

- [ ] Chrome(version >=76)
- [ ] Safari (version >= 12)
- [X] Firefox (version >= 69)

And on the following mobile browser (only when you have real test devices):

- [X] iOS Safari (version >= 12)
- [X] Samsung Internet (version >= 9)
- [X] Chrome for Android (version >= 76)

For the first mobile tests without real devices, you can run your code in chrome devtools [device-mode](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode). Here, please run it at minimum for the following devices:

Tested on Firefox (version >= 69)
- [X] Galaxy S5
- [X] iPhone 6/7/8
- [X] Pixel 2
- [X] iPhone X
- [X] IPad

## 2. The Flight ( Not Done )

To get to our hotel, we also need a flight. But here our backend-üêµ has no idea how he can start with the development.

Your second task is to explain our backend-üêµ what you need from him as a data structure for an API endpoint.

Here you are entirely free how the data structure should look like and which format it should have. Think about what you need to show us also a flight list where we can search flight to our hotel.

Please describe with your own words in a text what you need and give us a short example with dummy data how your data structure will look like. See this text as a briefing for a KickOff meeting that all departments can sit together and talk about the next steps.
